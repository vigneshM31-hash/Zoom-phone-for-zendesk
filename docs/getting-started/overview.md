# Overview

The **Zoom Phone + Zendesk Widget** integrates Zoom Phone directly into Zendesk Support.  

Agents can manage calls, tickets, and notes without leaving Zendesk.

## How It Works

1. **Login:** Agents enter their Zoom email and password in the embedded Zoom iframe.

2. **Incoming Calls:** When a call is received, the widget displays:

   - Caller’s Zendesk ticket (if exists)  
   - Options to create a new ticket or add notes to an existing ticket

3. **Ticket Navigation:** Clicking a ticket in the widget opens it directly in Zendesk.  

4. **Outgoing Calls:** Agents can dial customers using the widget interface.  

5. **Recent Calls View:** The **RecentCalls** tab shows a list of past calls with details like caller name, time, duration, and linked ticket.

6. **Contact List View:** The **ContactList** tab provides a searchable list of Zendesk contacts with quick actions to start a call or view related tickets.
